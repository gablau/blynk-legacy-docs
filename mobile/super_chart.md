### SuperChart

SuperChart is used to visualise live and historical data. You can use it for sensor data, for binary event logging and more.

To use SuperChart widget you would need to push the data from the hardware with the desired interval by using timers.
[Here is](https://examples.blynk.cc/?board=ESP8266&shield=ESP8266%20WiFi&example=GettingStarted%2FPushData) a basic example for data pushing.

#### Interactions:
- **Switch between time ranges and Live mode**
</br>Tap time ranges at the bottom of the widget to change time ranges

- **Tap Legend Elements** to show or hide datastreams
</br>

- **Tap'n'hold to view timestamp and corresponding values**

- **Quick swipe from left to right to reveal previous data**</br>
Then you can then scroll data back and forward within the given time range.

- **Full Screen Mode**</br>
Press this button to open Full Screen view in landscape orientation.

Simply rotate the phone back to portrait mode. Chart should rotate automagically. 
In full screen view you will see X (time) and multiple Y scales. 
Full Screen Mode can be disabled from widget Settings.

- **Menu Button**</br>
Menu button will open additional functions:
	- Export to CSV
	- Erase Data on the server 

#### SuperChart Settings:
- **Chart Title**
- **Title Font Size**</br>
You have a choice of 3 font sizes
- **Title Alignment**</br>
Choose chart title alignment. This setting also affects Title and Legend position on the Widget.
- **Show x-axis (time)**</br>
Select it if you want to show the time label at the bottom of your chart.
- **Time ranges picker**</br>
Allows you to select required periods (`15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `3h`, ...) and resolution for your chart. Resolution
defines how precise your data is. Right now chart supports 2 types of resolution `standard` and `high`. Resolution also
depends on the selected period. For example, `standard` resolution for `1d` means you'll get 24 points per day (1 per hour),
with `high` resolution you'll get for `1d` 1440 points per day (1 per minute).
- **Datastreams**</br>
Add datastreams (read below how to configure datastreams)

#### Datastream Settings

Widget supports up to 4 Datastreams. 
Press Datastream Settings Icon to open Datastream Settings.


**Design:**
Choose available types of Chart:

- Line
- Area
- Bar
- Binary (anchor LINK to binary)

**Color:**
Choose solid colors or gradients

**Source and input:**
You can use 3 types of Data source: 

**1. Virtual Pin**
Choose the desired Device and Virtual Pin to read the data from. 

**2. Tags**
SuperChart can aggregate data from multiple devices using built-in aggregation functions. 
For example, if you have 10 Temperature sensors sending temperature with the given period, 
you can plot average value from 10 sensors on the widget.

To use Tags:

- **[Add Tag](#blynk-main-operations-control-of-multiple-devices-tags)** to every device you want to aggregate data from.
- **Push data to the same Virtual Pin** on every device. (e.g. ```Blynk.virtualWrite (V0, temperature);```)
- **Choose Tag as a source** in SuperChart Widget and use the pin where the data is coming to (e.g V0)<br>

**Functions available:** 
	
- `SUM` will summarize all incoming values to the specified Virtual Pin across all devices tagged with the chosen tag
- `AVG` will plot average value
- `MED` will find a median value
- `MIN` will plot minimum value
- `MAX` will plot maximum value
	

**☝️ IMPORTANT: Tags are not working in Live Mode.**

3. **[Device Selector](#widgets-time-input-device-selector)**
If you add Device Selector Widget to your project, you can use it as a source for SuperChart. 
In this case, when you change the device in Device Selector, chart will be updated accordingly

**Y-Axis Settings**
<br>There are 4 modes of how to scale data along the Y axis

1. *Auto*<br>
Data will be auto-scaled based on min and max values of the given time period. This is nice option to start with.

2. **Min/Max**<br>
When this mode is selected, Y scale will be set to the values you choose. 
For example, if your hardware sends data with values varying from -100 to 100, you can set the chart 
to this values and data will be rendered correctly.

You may also want to visualize the data within some specific range. 
Let's say incoming data has values in the range of 0-55, but you would like to see only values in the range 30-50. 
You can set it up and if values are out of Y scale you configured, chart will be cropped

3. **% of Height**<br>
This option allows you to auto-scale incoming data on the widget and position it the way you want. 
In this mode, you set up the percentage of widget height on the screen, from 0% to 100%. 

If you set 0-100%, in fact it's a full auto-scale. No matter in which range the data is coming,  
it will be always scaled to the whole height of the widget.

If you set it to 0-25%, then this chart will only be rendered on 1/4 of the widget height.

This setting is very valuable for **Binary Chart** or for visualizing a few datastreams on the same chart in a different way.

4. *Delta*<br>
While data stays within the given Delta value, chart will be auto-scaled within this range.
If delta exceeds the range, chart will be auto-scaled to min/max values of the given period.

**Suffix**<br>
Here you can specify a suffix that will be shown during the Tap'n'hold.

**Decimals**<br>
Defines the formatting of the graph value when you Tap'n'hold the graph. Possible options are: #, #.#, #.##, etc.

**Connect Missing Data Points**<br>
If this switch is ON, then SuperChart will connect all the dots even if there was no data.

If it's set to OFF, then you will see gaps in case there was no data.

**Binary Chart Settings**<br>
This type of chart is useful to plot binary data, for example when unit was ON or OFF, or when motion was detected or when certain threshold was reached.

You need to specify a **FLIP** point, which is the point where incoming data will be turned into TRUE or FALSE state.

For example, you send the data in the range of `0 to 1023`. If you set `512` as a **FLIP** point, then everything above `512` (excluding 512) will be recorded as `TRUE`, any value below `512` (including 512) will be `FALSE`.

Another example, if you send `0 and 1` and set `0` as a **FLIP** point, then `1` will be `TRUE`, `0` will be `FALSE`

**State Labels:**<br>
Here you can specify how `TRUE/FALSE` should be shown in Tap'n'Hold mode. 

For example, you can set to `TRUE` to "Equipment ON" label, `FALSE` to "Equipment OFF".
